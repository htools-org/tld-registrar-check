# TLD Registrar Check

Small page that finds all registrars where a TLD is listed.
Meant for [Handshake](https://handshake.org) names,
especially those staked with [Namebase Registry](https://namebase.io).

Supported Registrars:

- Namecheap
- Encirca
- Porkbun
- 101Domain

## Run

```sh
npm run start
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`.
Files in this directory are treated as
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
instead of React pages.

## Contributions

This was made as a one-off utility and I don't plan to add extra features.
Any PR to fix things is welcome! (or fork for major changes, I'll link to your project here)

## License

MIT. Feel free to rip the code, though it's ugly and may not be of much use.
